### Introduction
Since <span eid="Q739711">Epic Games</span> launched Fortnite in September 2017, it has seen an explosion of participation in the number of players around the world, amounting to 550 million registered users as of 2024.[^Ref 1] The gendered participation leans heavy on the male side with nearly 90%, which is not surprising given its status as a first-person shooter.[^Ref 2] Perhaps what is surprising, though, is the age of participants. From the date of birth on registered accounts, it is calculated that over 60% are between 18 and 24.[^Ref 3] Of course, this number could be skewed due to children lying about their age but estimates still suggest at least half of the players are over 18.[^Ref 4] What this indicates is that the stereotype of Fortnite being a game for 12-year-old boys may not tell the whole story of the Fortnite community.

Fortnite’s most popular Battle Royale game is a first-person shooter in which players drop from a flying bus onto a fixed island map with 99 other players. The object of the game is to be the last remaining player on the island by collecting items such as guns and med kits necessary for eliminating other players and restoring one’s own health. Yet, different from the more violent shooting games such as Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto, Fortnite offers “a more cartoony, tongue-in-cheek type of experience” that appeals to a broader gamer base.[^Ref 5] Fortnite seems to have been able to attract a diverse body of gamers “by integrating a free-to-play revenue model, offering a friendly colorful aesthetic, and facilitating cross-platform gameplay.”[^Ref 6] This means that someone is able to play the game and compete without any financial investment, enjoy the game as a fun and quirky engagement with popular culture, and connect with gamers across different consoles. Fortnite, then, becomes a point of interest in understanding the literacies shared among members of its gaming community.

In this study of the Fortnite community, I am interested in developing a deeper understanding of the aspects and elements of gameplay and participation that most capture the experience of the Fortnite community. In other words, what are the literacies and experiences gained by and shared among people who play Fortnite? Through this investigation, I intend to draw out the commonalities across diverse participants and represent the significance of the community’s engagement with popular culture in and beyond the game itself.

To this end, it is important for me to acknowledge my positionality within the Fortnite community and in conducting this investigation. As a casual Fortnite gamer myself, I have my own personal experience and perspective which colors and shapes my own understanding of what it means to belong to the Fortnite community. Nevertheless, I have decided to conduct this research as an outsider looking in. Thus, expositions and explanations will be based on the experiences and perspectives of others, but analysis of my findings will be my own.

#### Methodology
My investigation utilized a methodological approach which combined three types of research: interviews with self-identified Fortnite gamers, observation of groups actively playing Fortnite, and dialogue with current scholarship on Fortnite. There were four interviews conducted via Zoom with a semi-structured questioning sequence highlighting the origin of participation, types of current engagement, literacies gained through participation, and testimonials concerning why they find the game attractive. Since previous scholarly conversation tends to focus on the experience of minors, I selected four young adults to be interviewed: Juan (29, male), Noah (26, male), Zoe (20, female), and Demi (21, female). Each of them self-identified as people who both play and talk about Fortnite on a regular basis. Additionally, I observed a group of four Fortnite players and another group of two players for an approximate total of 2.5 hours (or 10 rounds of Fortnite Battle Royale). Through a review of the interview contents and observation notes, three overarching themes organically emerged: community, fun, and pop culture. Additionally, of the myriad artifacts contained within the world of Fortnite, I chose to highlight the four which best characterized the collective experience of the four interviewees: (1) events, (2) emotes, (3) skins, and (4) competition. I then grouped interviewees according to the artifacts they identified as most significant and put these experiences in dialogue with the previous literature on Fortnite and its membership. By giving voice to its participants, I was able to better describe and analyze the meaning of Fortnite community membership.

#### Events: "watching your character watch"
One of the major artifacts from the Fortnite community is the virtual phenomenon of in-game events. These events are either live or limited time moments when players can participate in activities such as concerts, map changes, and character unveilings. For example, Noah brought up his experience of engaging with the Silk Sonic feature and the subsequent unveiling of Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak as characters in the game. He said that events and subsequent unveilings like this help to keep the game “fun and fresh.” Noah also added that Fortnite has added so much actual pop culture music that “there’s even a radio station.” Players can listen to this radio station while they drive cars during gameplay or wait in the pre-game lobby.

Alternatively, Demi recounted some of the events which she has participated in during her own Fortnite engagement. She shared: “So I'd wake up at like 8 AM just to watch like Inception on Fortnite with my friends…it was like you were watching your character watch the movie on a screen.”  In fact, Fortnite has screened other films during an event known as “Movie Nite,” including Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight and The Prestige.[^Ref 7] Demi also mentioned how she attended a live in-game concert hosted by Ariana Grande “that happened when I was in high school.” Interestingly, while she acknowledged that it is kind of “weird” to watch your avatar watch something real or live, she emphasized: “I honestly just love having like a place to like connect with my friends, even if I can't connect with them in person.”

To give an idea of the scale of these virtual social events, we can point out some prominent examples. During a live concert hosted by <span eid="Q26334949">DJ Marshmello</span> in February 2019, approximately 10 million members of the Fortnite community tuned in. In light of this, Patrick Shanley explains that “Not only does Fortnite encourage players to hone their skills in competitive matches, but it also offers activities for people who just want to hang out in its virtual world.”[^Ref 8] For reference, the most-attended live in-person concert to date was about 3.5 million people.[^Ref 9] This comparison points to the reality that unlike in-person spaces, virtual space provides seemingly unlimited capacity with a sense of being close to the action.

Additionally, Travis Scott hosted a [live in-game concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYeFAlVC8qU) with Fortnite that boasted a staggering 12.3 million viewers.[^Ref 10] Moreover, because of the freemium business model Fortnite proffers, these concerts are among the plethora of free activities. This capacity of Fortnite to offer free opportunities for massive online connection adds to the game’s communal dimension. As Rick Marlatt observes, “Rather than operating as individuals in isolated structures, participation in Fortnite implies active communal membership in the game’s ever-expanding, global neighborhood.”[^Ref 11] For Noah and Demi, as well as for the others, Fortnite has been a site of communal fun as they enjoy popular culture movies and music mediated through an experience of gameplay.

#### Emotes: "the goofiness of the game itself"
Another significant part of the Fortnite experience is the countless emotes available to players. Emotes are dances or gestures that players can make their avatars perform in the game. The dances are accompanied by music, and some of them can even be done as a duet with other players. These dances and gestures help provide the Fortnite community with a way to interact with one another in and outside the game. It is, as Noah puts it, part of “the absurdity” and “the goofiness of the game itself.” These emotes are intimately tied to popular media scrolling platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. In fact, according to Ali Johnson and Lauren Hutton-work, there have even been lawsuits concerning whether Fortnite violated copyright law in creating equivalents to many popular TikTok or Instagram dances in the mainstream media.[^Ref 12] For our conversation, it is enough to recognize that this conflict results from the interrelationship between mainstream pop culture and the Fortnite community.
<param ve-image

	label="Fortnite Icon for the original Dance Moves emote"

During one interview, Juan playfully told me about his enjoyment of the emote feature of the game. He said that one of his favorite emotes plays <span eid="Q219237">Rick Astley</span>’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” while the avatar performs “this dance from the music video from the 80s,” which, he says, “was made for people of my generation.” He also shared that there are at least three ways people tend to utilize the emote feature. The first way is when players eliminate another player. To celebrate their momentary triumph and to taunt the other player (whose screen is now viewing the player who eliminated them), most players play their favorite emote. A second way emotes are used is to acknowledge defeat in a one-on-one battle. He said that sometimes a player will “bow down” to the other by halting fire and beginning to dance. Finally, a third use for emotes comes when someone wins. There is a Victory Royale “icon that pops up, and there’s this whole like sound that goes with it.” Many players utilize this moment of victory to celebrate with their favorite emote. Juan noted further that players usually have certain emotes that they like to use for certain situations, which serves to add to their sense of personal gamer identity.
<param ve-image

Not everyone, however, is drawn to using emotes in the context of competition. Demi, for example, talked about her memories associated with doing Fortnite emotes in real life. She said that there was one dance in particular, called the “Orange Justice,” which she and her friends used to try to do. In fact, she noted that, of all the aspects of Fortnite, “the dances are like the main things that like I’ll come across like in the wild.” In this way, Demi highlights something intriguing about the Fortnite community: the relationship between pop culture and Fortnite is like a two-way street. But the fact that she refers to reality as “the wild” presupposes the way the virtual world of Fortnite occupies a space of natural belonging for many people in relation to pop culture artifacts. For Demi, it is natural to see emotes in the game but finding them outside the gameworld registers as strange, revealing that Fortnite players experience the game as a real social context.

Emotes are also an important part of the business model of Fortnite, as players can purchase specific dances from the in-game shop by using the game currency known as “V-Bucks.” As Timo Schöber and Georg Stadtmann highlight, “While the game can be downloaded and played free of charge, an in-game-shop offers a variety of uniforms (‘skins’), parachutes (‘gliders’), or dance moves (‘emotes’).”[^Ref 13] Moreover, Schöber and Stadtmann explain that “Fortnite picked the right conversion rates to create a high degree of ‘money illusion’” among players, which means that players are disconnected from the actual cost of items in the shop because they are making purchases with a foreign virtual currency.[^Ref 14] This illusory financial experience among players pairs with players’ attraction to utilizing cartoon-like emotes, which, for Juan, “lends to being able to talk to people about it in a casual way, and kind of a fun way.” This urge to be a part of the conversation is something that Fortnite seems to tap into in attracting so many players to financially invest in their place in the Fortnite community.

#### Skins: "just to look cool"
Even more attractive for players is the opportunity to purchase new and unique outfits for their avatar, called “skins.” Some skins can be gained free of charge from playing the game and fulfilling certain quests, but most of them cost V-Bucks in the in-game shop. These skins are one of the most dynamic ways that Fortnite interacts with popular culture. For example, Zoe shared that “They had a like collaboration with Family Guy, which was awesome because like it was really funny to see like Peter Griffin in the game. I think I don't usually spend money on the game, but I think I spent $20 so I could like dress up as Peter.” Zoe is not alone in making “unusual” purchases in the shop. Juan also talked about his purchase of the “Battle Pass” and skins, “solidifying my membership in the Fortnite community.” With a chuckle, he added, “I spend real life money in the game just to look cool.” But this trend of making in game purchases for outfits “just to look cool” belongs to the majority of Fortnite participants, with 77% of players reporting having spent real money in the game.[^Ref 15]

Part of the appeal of Fortnite for its participants is that the skins allow for blending of pop culture artifacts. Noah, for instance, stated that Fortnite is “a place where I think there's a huge blending of the pop culture so like you could be Iron Man, but you're like dancing to a Bruno Mars song.” This capacity to blend pop culture characters, music, and dances adds to the fun and silliness of the cartoon feel. For this reason, Zoe praised the game, saying, “It doesn’t seem like the game cares about anything except like being fun.” Juan also shared this sensibility. When asked what makes the game so attractive, he said, “You can be a fish, or you can be a banana. It doesn't matter. You can play as any character, and you can dance.” For all the interviewees, whether they play as Peter Griffin, Bruno Mars, or a banana, the absurdity of using pop culture likenesses and dances while participating in an unrealistic, cartoony fight to the death with friends makes Fortnite a place where they can be silly and goofy. As Demi put it, “It’s just fun that way.”

	label="Peely the Banana"
	description="Peely the Banana"

	fit="contain">

Another aspect of engagement for players is that Fortnite is virtually always changing, updating, and creating content. One of the places where things shift and change often is the in-game shop, where skins are regularly added and removed from the virtual rack. Of course, this is part of Fortnite’s business model, creating a scarcity effect through a limited-time-only approach.[^Ref 16] Yet, for fans, this constant change keeps the game interesting. For example, Juan stated that this constant updating and blending of pop culture content “keeps my attention because there’s always something new.” Moreover, as Juan indicated before, purchasing skins solidifies membership in the community, as “Skins are a status symbol among the young generation.”[^Ref 17] By dressing their avatar in their favorite skins (rather than playing with the Fortnite stock character), Fortnite players gain a sense of belonging in the community and show their opponents that they are real gamers.

#### Competition: "anyone can play Fortnite"
In the collective experience of Fortnite players, the artifact that stands out the most in the community is the competitive dimension of the game. This competition is most immediately on display in Battle Royale, but, for many players, it also extends beyond the game to include the habit of watching professional streamers on YouTube and Twitch as well as the presence of the Fortnite community on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Discord. One of the major reasons why Fortnite Battle Royale can be competitive for so many people is due to the cross-platform model Fortnite provides. [Cross-platform gaming](https://www.cutscenesleep.com/blogs/news/from-final-fantasy-to-fortnite-the-evolution-of-cross-platform-gaming?srsltid=AfmBOorksz8-r2bwKL9wNGt3DXU2VPZrKJLI53WthDTj32GHd9RNBFFU) allows players to compete regardless of their console. This means that a player with a Nintendo Switch can play against someone with an Xbox or PlayStation in the same game. This was simply not possible until Fortnite came on the scene and forced the video game industry to allow it. Zoe highlighted how cross-platform gaming marks Fortnite as very accessible: “Anyone can play Fortnite because it’s free and it’s on every platform.” She went on to discuss how Fortnite’s ongoing effort to balance the competition by opening the community to a broader player base keeps her engaged with a game that could too easily belong to the “sweaty” 1% of professional players.

The element of communal competition was highlighted by Juan and Noah. For example, Noah, who shared that “I don’t play video games by myself,” emphasized how “the teamwork” and “the interaction you can have with other players” contributes to his experience of fun. Similarly, Juan shared that, while he at first didn’t enjoy “getting annihilated by probably 12-year-olds online,” playing the game with others showed him “it was fun to coordinate and to work as a team.” Their experience of communal competition demonstrates the localized way that Fortnite gamers play. Juan pointed out that sometimes this localized experience of Fortnite competition can grow into what gamers call “LAN Parties.” These “local area network parties” allow players to be physically present with each other while they play together virtually online. As Moore and Carter assert, “Fortnite becomes a vehicle for the accumulation and performance of social capital, both online through gameplay but also offline through the demonstration of expertise about the gameworld or game practices.”[^Ref 18] Moreover, Noah discussed how localized gameplay language can result from these in-person sessions, giving the example of how he and his friends initiate gameplay by asking others if they want to get “dubs,” which is a play on “wins.” Similarly, Juan gave the example of the term “get juicy,” which means “play Fortnite competitively” and which is inspired by the “chug jugs” players can drink to recuperate their health in the game. Thus, the Fortnite community’s competition is also an act of competitive literacy whereby players learn “to translate the words they use into effective decisions embodied by moves on the screen, which are visible to other gamers.”[^Ref 19]

Fortnite participants also engage online via social media by sharing and viewing clips from their performances on the battlefield, engaging in commentary on the game or certain players, and watching professional streamers on YouTube or Twitch. While Zoe and Demi admitted that their engagement with the Fortnite community is more interested in the social, pop culture, and aesthetic dimensions, Noah and Juan spoke of their engagement with Fortnite outside of the game itself. For example, Noah shared that people playing Fortnite is one regular item that shows up on his TikTok feed. For him, this engagement with Fortnite on platforms like TikTok increases his “excitement” at playing the game. Jaun also spoke about viewing Fortnite community content on social media, admitting that “Fortnite streamers” will show up on his feed and “sometimes I’ll watch them play.” The dynamic circle of playing online, watching others play, and talking about playing creates a discourse continuum for Fortnite participants which both builds Fortnite vocabulary and promotes a sense of belonging to the broader community of Fortnite gamers. According to all the interviewees, the practice of watching other people play or talk about Fortnite is a regular feature of the Fortnite community.

In the fullest sense of the word, the Fortnite community plays. From the shared experiences in online events and in-person cooperative gaming to the fun and enjoyment of cartoon representations of pop culture characters and dances, the Fortnite community is marked by its broad openness to new and diverse membership, its balance of playfulness and competition, and the dynamic interplay between real-world cultural artifacts and in-game virtual activities. In terms of literacy, members of the Fortnite community gain a space of expanding social and popular awareness. This results in a community that is accessible, diverse, broad, and playful. The interviewees each pointed out that the reason they play Fortnite is because it is a fun way to connect with others. Part of this fun is the gameplay, but more than this is the way Fortnite affords interaction with popular culture. As Gouriou affirms, the pop culture crossovers “tie the fabric of Fortnite into the real world of its player base.”[^Ref 20] This tying together of the player’s virtual and real-world experience establishes a communal identity with other Fortnite gamers that is not limited by the time and space of actual gameplay. Instead, the Fortnite community blurs the lines between real and online spaces, occupying a world of its own capable of including competitive combat, colorful costumes, pop stars, music, movies, TV shows, and so much more. At times, Fortnite stereotypes are built upon the characteristics of other video game communities: awkward middle-school boys, lonely and isolated adults, escape from reality, lack of social awareness, ignorance of mainstream pop culture, and engagement with obscure social media content. However, the Fortnite community challenges these stereotypes with its unique participation and fascination with pop cultural artifacts, emphasis on community engagement, and appreciation for silly and childish cartoon fun. Perhaps more than any other gaming community, Fortnite reveals to what extent “playing is a universal human activity.”[^Ref 21]
